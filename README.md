# Auto Auto

> UNFINISHED ARCHIVE

## What is this?

This unfinished mod automatically finds and plays auto levels in Geometry Dash. It actually works pretty well, but it is not finished yet. The code is also kind of messy.

## Can I use this?

Yes, you can use this code for whatever you want. Just please, credit me if you use a part of it.

If you would like to release this mod, you would just have to fix the audio downloading. The mod even finds the audo ids, you would just have to download them. The rest of the code works fine.

## Why is your code so messy?

It was 3am

## Why are you releasing this unfinished mod?

I decided to quit Geode Modding, so I am releasing all of my unfinished mods. This is one of them.
